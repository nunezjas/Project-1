# Project-1
# Rock Paper Scissors â€“ Numerical Results Game

This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python and Pygame. It includes sound effects, images, and graphical output using Matplotlib to display numerical results of the game.

## Features
- Clickable images for rock, paper, and scissors
- Randomized computer choice
- Sound effects for win, loss, and draw
- Bar chart of total outcomes shown at the end

## Numerical Output
After all rounds, the game displays a bar graph showing:
- Total Computer Wins
- Total User Wins
- Total Ties

This visualizes how outcomes are distributed during gameplay using Matplotlib.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pygame matplotlib
